Android-Intents
===============

Android app, showing examples of an Explicit Intent and a Implicit Intent. 
The Explcit intent also returns data from one activity to another.
The Implicit Intent sends the user to another app and gives it a choice of apps. (createChooser()).

For this app to work, you need the app MyBrowser....to give android a choice of browsers. 
THis app is in the repository Ger123/Android-MyBrowser.
